  <h1>Helen Keller - World-Famous Author and Activist</h1>
<div id="i" > <img src="hk.jpg" alt="hellenkiller" height="700"></div>
  <div class="p1">Early Life</div>
  <div class="p2">
    <p>A world-famous author, Keller was also a trailblazer in disability rights, a political activist, and lecturer who became the first deaf-blind person to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree.</p>
    <p>Born on 27 June 1880 in Tuscumbia, Alabama to parents Arthur and Kate Keller, she was raised on the family-owned cotton plantation farm.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="p1">Education</div>
  <div class="p2">
    <p>In May 1888, Keller started attending the Perkins Institute for the Blind. In 1894, Keller and Sullivan moved to New York to attend the Wright-Humason School for the Deaf, and to learn from Sarah Fuller at the Horace Mann School for the Deaf. In 1896, they returned to Massachusetts, and Keller entered The Cambridge School for Young Ladies before gaining admittance, in 1900, to Radcliffe College of Harvard University, where she lived in Briggs Hall, South House. Her admirer, Mark Twain, had introduced her to Standard Oil magnate Henry Huttleston Rogers, who, with his wife Abbie, paid for her education. In 1904, at the age of 24, Keller graduated as a member of Phi Beta Kappa from Radcliffe, becoming the first deaf-blind person to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree. She maintained a correspondence with the Austrian philosopher and pedagogue Wilhelm Jerusalem, who was one of the first to discover her literary talent.</p>

  <div class="p1">Communication and Achievements</div>
  <div class="p2">
    <p>Determined to communicate with others as conventionally as possible, Keller learned to speak and spent much of her life giving speeches and lectures on aspects of her life. She learned to "hear" people's speech using the Tadoma method, which means using her fingers to feel the lips and throat of the speaker. She became proficient at using braille and using fingerspelling to communicate. Shortly before World War I, with the assistance of the Zoellner Quartet, she determined that by placing her fingertips on a resonant tabletop she could experience music played close by.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="p1">Later Life and Death</div>
  <div class="p2">
    <p>Keller had a series of strokes in 1961 and spent the last years of her life at her home.</p>
    <p>On September 14, 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the United States' two highest civilian honors. In 1965 she was elected to the National Women's Hall of Fame at the New York World's Fair.</p>
    <p>Keller devoted much of her later life to raising funds for the American Foundation for the Blind. She died in her sleep on June 1, 1968, at her home, Arcan Ridge, located in Easton, Connecticut, a few weeks short of her eighty-eighth birthday. A service was held at the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., and her body was cremated in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Her ashes were buried at the Washington National Cathedral next to her constant companions, Anne Sullivan, and Polly Thomson.</p>
